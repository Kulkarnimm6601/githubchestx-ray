I am using the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle to train a simple CNN for pneumonia detection. The dataset splits pneumonia into two categories: viral and bacterial. The model does not differentiate between these two categories.
Model Deployment
Classifier is deployed via FastAPI + Docker. The endpoint accepts uploaded files and infers from the image whether there is pneumonia.
